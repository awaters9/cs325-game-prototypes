<h2>Feed Me, I'm Small</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a puzzle game about understanding player size
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The more the player consumes the larger the player object becomes. Making it impossible to traverse through certain parts of the map
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about level design and how to design a level to highlight the game's mechanics. The easiest part was designing the mechanic but the most troublesome part was figuring out interesting levels for the player to explore.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
That game where you roll a sticky ball and collect things reminds me of this kinda game. Except this one has a puzzle element to it.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a hippo who must eat every fruit to proceed to the next level.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
There is no randomness to the game. You may move left, right, and jump. This type of game is a platformer that emphasizes puzzle elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating the player's critical thinking skills and dexterity to solve puzzles and avoid messing yourself up.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to think about the best route to navigate through levels. Sometimes, players must also have skill in order to make the correct jumps while avoiding the objective.
Sometimes players must backtrack.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS to move side to side.
The SPACEBAR allows the player to JUMP.
The R button RESETS the level.
The core mechanic consists of navigating a level and eat all the fruit. The game is meant to be a puzzle while incorporating platforming elements. Most of the diversity in this game will come with level designs.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players may want to explore a level first in order to get an idea for what to do. Having platforming skills will also assist the player in completing challenging levels.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a hippo who only dreams of gorging on various fruits no matter how humongous he becomes. Explore lush green environments to find the sweet fruits, but be careful; sometimes the world doesn't want the hippo to reach such delights. Game tension doesnt exist. The challenge comes with the player's ability to figure out a level's puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game will appeal to children and even young adults who appreciate challenging platform puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The prototype takes about 3 minutes
</li>
