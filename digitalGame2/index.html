<h2>Lost With Thought **IMPORTANT** plz read first</h2>

<ul>
This is a two player game. Grab a friend and one of you decide who will be looking <a href="cheetSheat.png">at this</a> the whole time.
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is a maze game that requires two players. One player is in charge of maneuvering the maze while the other player must help navigate. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game expands further as the player explores the maze. This is done with the help of unique tile layers and collision objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about Tiled and how to interact with game colliders that are stamped onto the map.
The easiest part was coming up with the idea for the prototype, the most challenging aspect was determining the solution to get the maze to uncover like it does.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the game assets from scratch. Except for the audio files.
<ul>
<li>AirHorn: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHDtEKzRGZU">Lose Points Noise</a></li>
<li>Trumpet: <a href="http://soundbible.com/1003-Ta-Da.html">Win Noise</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game mechanics are similiar to Keep Talking and Nobody Dies. Where two people are meant to relay information to eachother in order to succeed. Simultaneously the game is supposed to play like a point-n'-click adventure.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Can you and your friend navigate this maze without losing any points?
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
**Presses ignore button**
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
This game is set to be a point-n-click adventure game spent with your friend. There isn't any randomness to the game, it is meant to challenge two friends and bring people closer together. This is done by requiring the players to talk with eachother in order to reach the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is meant to evaluate if this sort of teamwork could be fun within a point-n'-click game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel like they can accomplish goals when they work together. So often do games provide the opposite. Progression is a solo experience but this game is supposed to break that tradition.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The CORE MECHANIC is based around communication between two individuals.
This is a two player game where one player is meant to maneuver the game world while the other player only see's the cheat sheet. Neither player should be allowed to watch the other's perspective. This is strictly meant for both players to communicate verbally.
The GOAL for both players is to reach the end point which is recognized as a highlighted blue end.

The player who is MANEUVERING will click on points in the game world and uncover more of the map.
The player who is NAVIGATING will help the other player determine which way to go in order to avoid dead ends.

This concept could definitely be expanded upon to determine what could be fun about this gameplay. Perhaps there could be secondary goals like keys to unlock passages, enemies to encounter, puzzles to deal with.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
This is up for the players to determine their own communicative strategy. Communication is dynamic and people may tell information different than others.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
I haven't thought about any of this. The choice to come up with a game world is so vast that I can't quite put a decision to this. When I was thinking about the gameplay, I remembered from the Metal Gear games how Snake could communicate with his intel informant through some walkie talkie. I then started thinking about how that interaction between Snake and his informant could work between two characters. Perhaps the game could be set as a spy game? This would make sense for enemies and keys and other gameplay elements that are not found within the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I wanted to reach people who enjoy playing games with others.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The prototype will take about 1 minute or 2.
</li>

</ul>
